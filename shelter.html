  <h2> The perfect shopping center for your new and <span class="only"><em>only</em></span> companion!</h2>
<p>If you've stumbled upon this site, odds are you're a pretty lonely person seeking companionship through monetary access. Fear not, there's hope! Now <em>YOU</em> can degradingly scroll through photos of your would-be best friend, only to end up quitting and forking over $950 for a golden retriever puppy.</p>

    <div class="ricobox"><h1>Meet Ricardo: The Man of Your Dreams</h1></div> 
      <div class="textbox">Ricardo is a strong-willed,loose-nosed floppy fiend from the seventh layer of hell itself. Many speculate Ricardo is, in fact, actually an <em>esoteric <strong>demon</strong></em>, however he's pretty much just a nice saggy cuddle partner. He'll love you indefinitely for the exchange of a few measly tortilla chips. Stupid Ricardo. </div>

        <h1>Rejinald, The <em>Leathery</em></h1>
        <p>Rejinald, The Leathery, is our newest find. We stumbled upon him alone naked in a smouldering crop circle, finding him glowing neon blue with his tiny cowboy hat perched upon his strong, leathery noggin. If you like gambling, you're sure to enjoy Rejinald because we haven't the faintest clue if he is even from this planet.</p>
